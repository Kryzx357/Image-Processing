# Image-Processing

This repository contains a library of existing files used to practice various opencv 
functions and workflows for basic image processing use. 
The files when run need to be linked to the image file path of the desired image. 
This currently has to done within the files themselves. 
The files are currently setup to read a file for a "Data" folder.
this folder must be in the same directory path.
In later versions the desired image selection will be modifable without the need to edit
the function files.
